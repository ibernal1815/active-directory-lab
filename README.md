# Silverline Technologies Active Directory Lab

This repository documents a complete **Active Directory lab environment** for a fictional company, **Silverline Technologies**.  
The lab simulates a small enterprise setup with a domain controller, file server, and Windows clients.  

It demonstrates skills in **Active Directory, DNS, Group Policy, File Services, and IT troubleshooting** ‚Äî all key areas for IT Support, Helpdesk, and System Administrator roles.

## üî∑ Lab Environment

- **Domain Controller (DC01)**  
  Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), DNS  
  Domain: `silverline.local`

  Shared folders and departmental shares with NTFS + Shar
- **File Server (FS01)**  e permissions

- **Clients (CLIENT1, CLIENT2)**  
  Windows 10/11 workstations, joined to the domain

- **Networking**  
  VirtualBox Host-Only network: `10.0.25.0/24`  
  Static IPs assigned to each VM  
  Clients point DNS to DC01 (10.0.25.10)

- **Host PC Specs**  
  - Intel 10-core / 16-thread CPU  
  - 48 GB DDR4 RAM  
  - 2 TB HDD (VM storage)  
  - Windows 11 Pro host  
  - Oracle VirtualBox

## üî∑ Project Phases

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Active Directory + DNS Setup
- Promoted DC01 as domain controller
- Created `silverline.local` domain + DNS zones
- Verified name resolution and connectivity

### Phase 2 ‚Äî File Server Setup
- Configured FS01 with shared folders:
  - `\\FS01\Shared` (all users)
  - Departmental shares: HR, IT, Finance
- Applied NTFS + Share permissions
- Tested access and ‚ÄúAccess Denied‚Äù scenarios

### Phase 3 ‚Äî OUs, Users, Groups, and Group Policies
- Created OUs for HR, IT, Finance, Users, and Computers
- Added users manually and via bulk script
- Created security groups and assigned users
- Applied Group Policies:
  - Password policy (length, complexity, lockout)
  - Login banner
  - Drive mappings (Z: shared drive, H:/I:/F: for departments)
- Tested with domain users on CLIENT1 and CLIENT2

---

## üî∑ Key Skills Demonstrated
- Active Directory design and management
- DNS configuration and troubleshooting
- File server permissions (NTFS vs Share)
- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for security and automation
- Bulk user creation with PowerShell
- Common IT troubleshooting workflows (DNS issues, permissions, password resets)
